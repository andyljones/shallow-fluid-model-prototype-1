This was the first pass at developing what would later become my [interactive shallow-fluid model](https://github.com/andyljones/shallow-fluid-model). Being my first ever program to exceed >100 LOC and my first experiment with the Unity engine, it is of course an absolute travesty. After realising the mess I'd made (but not quite realising the power of Git branches), I abandoned it in favour of [the next prototype](https://github.com/andyljones/shallow-fluid-model-prototype-2).
